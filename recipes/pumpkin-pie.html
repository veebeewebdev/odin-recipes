                href="https://www.theppk.com/2012/11/vegan-pumpkin-pie/">From
                theppk.com:</a> "This recipe first captured my heart in 2001. I
            had discovered Myra Kornfeld’s wonderful Voluptuous Vegan and was so
            happy to have a guide that used so many from-scratch vegan
            ingredients. This pie was actually my first ever attempt at a
            homemade vegan pumpkin pie and I haven’t strayed from it since. Why
            mess with perfection? It’s rich and creamy, and has got the perfect
            amount of autumn spices. Myra includes a nut topping in her original
            recipe, but I like mine unadulterated. Well, ok, maybe a little Rad
            Whip or other creamy topping, but that’s about it. The recipe is
            slightly modified from Voluptuous Vegan and appears in our pie book,
            Vegan Pie In The Sky."</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Single pastry crust, fit into a 9 inch pie plate3 cups cooked
                pumpkin or other sweet winter squash</li>
            <li>1/2 cup pure maple syrup</li>
            <li>1/2 cup plain unsweetened soy milk (or your favorite non-dairy
                milk)
                <li>4 teaspoons canola oil</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
                <li>1 /4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
                <li>Pinch ground cloves</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon agar powder</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Preheat oven to 350 F.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In a blender, pulse together pumpkin,
                    maple syrup, soy milk, canola oil, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg,
                    cloves, salt, cornstarch and agar powder until very smooth.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pour into the pie shell and bake for 60 to 65 minutes until
                    the center looks semi-firm not liquidy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Check the edges of
                    the crust after baking for 40 minutes; if the edges appear
                    to be browning too rapidly carefully remove the pie and
                    apply crust protectors to the edges to keep from getting too
                    dark.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove from oven and onto a cooling rack for 30
                    minutes, then chill for at least 4 hours before slicing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Serve with Rad Whip, vegan whipped topping or your favorite
                    vegan vanilla ice cream. In the photo, we piped cream around
                    the edges of the pie with a large decorating tip.
                </li>
